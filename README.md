# Mapping Earthquakes

In this module we learned to create interactive maps which are easy to use and can help explain data.  To create the maps we used GeoJSON which is the industry standard for representing simple geographic features and non-spatial attributes.  GeoJSON has geographic features such as Points, Linestrings and Polygons.  

In our exercise, we represented an example of a non-spatial attribute - the location and magnitude of earthquakes (an example of the GeoJSON Points feature) and the placement of tectonic plates (an example of the GeoJSON Linestring feature).  We also used Mapbox tools to style the tiles of the maps.  We used the street, satellite, and navigation night stylings.
